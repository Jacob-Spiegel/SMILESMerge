SMILESMerge is a cheminformatic, Python program that crosses two parent ligands (SMILES string) to create a child compound. SMILESMerge uses the crossover algorithm from the program AutoGrow4.

SMILESMerge accepts a list of SMILES (in .smi format) and will attempt to produce a user defined number of unique children SMILES. SMILESMerge also allows users to apply chemical property filters. Additionally, SMILESMerge options the automated conversion of the children from 1/2D SMILES to 3D representations (PDB and 3D-SDF) using Gypsum-DL.

# Using SMILESMerge

SMILESMerge is primarily a python based program which can be run through command-line and GUI interface. More details can be found within `/PATH/SMILESMerge/tutorial/tutorial.md` or by running:

`python /PATH/SMILESMerge/RunSMILESMerge.py -h`

## Command-Line Interface

In a terminal with a modern Python environment run either:

`python /PATH/SMILESMerge/RunSMILESMerge.py -j /PATH/To/JSON_Paramerter_File.json`

or

`python /PATH/SMILESMerge/RunSMILESMerge.py --source_compound_file  /PATH/To/SMILES_File.smi`

Where `/PATH/To/JSON_Paramerter_File.json` is a JSON file containing all user parameters and `/PATH/To/SMILES_File.smi` is a file of all SMILES to be crossed


## GUI Interface

The GUI interface requires the additional dependency of GOOEY (https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey). To use the GUI, please run the following command from a terminal with a modern Python environment:

`python /PATH/SMILESMerge/RunSMILESMerge_GUI.py `


# Dependencies

SMILESMerge requires the following dependencies:
- RDKit
- func_timeout
- scipy
- numpy
- mpi4py (optional but required for MPI multiprocessing)
- Gooey (optional but required for GUI interface)

SMILESMerge was tested on a Python 3.7.7 environment on a Ubuntu OS. A docker image is provided for users with unsupported operating systems, such as Windows.
